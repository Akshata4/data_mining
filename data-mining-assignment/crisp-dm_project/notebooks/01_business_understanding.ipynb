    "## Objective Clarification\n",
    "- Understand the factors affecting graduate admission.\n",
    "- Predict admission chances using relevant features from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Situation Assessment\n",
    "- **Resources**: Graduate admission dataset from Kaggle.\n",
    "- **Constraints**: CPU-only processing, reproducible results with fixed seeds, prevent data leakage.\n",
    "- **Assumptions**: Dataset is clean and accurately represents factors influencing admission.\n",
    "- **Risks**: Data leakage, overfitting, and potential bias in predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Determine Data Mining Goals\n",
    "- Predict the probability of admission based on GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university ratings, etc.\n",
    "- Evaluate features for their predictive power and relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Produce Project Plan\n",
    "- Document findings and insights in the Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "- Develop a roadmap for future phases: Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, Deployment.\n",
