    "# Phase 1: Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective Clarification\n",
    "- Understand the factors affecting graduate admission.\n",
    "- Predict admission chances using relevant features from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Situation Assessment\n",
    "- **Resources**: Graduate admission dataset from Kaggle.\n",
    "- **Constraints**: CPU-only processing, reproducible results with fixed seeds, prevent data leakage.\n",
    "- **Assumptions**: Dataset is clean and accurately represents factors influencing admission.\n",
    "- **Risks**: Data leakage, overfitting, and potential bias in predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Determine Data Mining Goals\n",
    "- Predict the probability of admission based on GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university ratings, etc.\n",
    "- Evaluate features for their predictive power and relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Produce Project Plan\n",
    "- Document findings and insights in the Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "- Develop a roadmap for future phases: Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, Deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps**\n",
    "- Proceed to Data Understanding phase upon completion of documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Enhanced Objective Clarification\n",
    "- Target Stakeholder: University admissions committees aiming to streamline the selection process.\n",
    "- Value Proposition: Automating and improving the accuracy of predicting admission chances to optimize decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Enhanced Situation Assessment\n",
    "- **Risks**: Potential for model misinterpretation affecting stakeholder trust. Ethical concerns over biased admission predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expanded Data Mining Goals\n",
    "- Success Criteria: Model accuracy above 80%; identification of key predictive features.\n",
    "- Dataset Limitations: Possible underrepresentation of certain demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed Project Planning\n",
    "- Timeline: Each phase to be completed within 1-2 weeks.\n",
    "- Initial Hypotheses: Higher GRE and TOEFL scores are positively correlated with admission chances.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps**\n",
    "- Conduct exploratory data analysis to verify hypotheses and prepare data for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specific Objectives\n",
    "- Develop a model to predict graduate admission chances based on academic scores, research experience, and university ratings.\n",
    "- Assist admissions committees in making data-driven decisions regarding applicant selections.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Identified Stakeholders\n",
    "- University Admissions Departments.\n",
    "- Data Analysts within Educational Institutions.\n",
    "- Educational Policy Makers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed Success Criteria\n",
    "- Achieve a prediction accuracy of at least 85%.\n",
    "- Identify top 3 predictive features that influence admission likelihood.\n",
    "- Provide actionable insights to reduce admission process bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comprehensive Risk Assessment\n",
    "- Possible biases due to underrepresented demographics in the dataset.\n",
    "- Data privacy concerns, particularly around sensitive applicant information.\n",
    "- Ensuring fair model predictions without overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specified Constraints\n",
    "- Data limited to publicly available Kaggle dataset.\n",
    "- Processing must be conducted with CPUs only, with a target model training time under 1 hour.\n"
