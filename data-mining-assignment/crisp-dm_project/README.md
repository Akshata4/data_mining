# Graduate Admission Prediction Project

This project aims to understand and predict the chances of graduate admission based on various features like GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university ratings, and more.

## Project Structure
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks documenting the CRISP-DM phases.
  - `01_business_understanding.ipynb`: Contains the business understanding phase.
  - `02_data_understanding.ipynb`: Contains the data understanding phase where we explore and analyze the dataset.
- **src/**: Source code for data processing and modeling (to be developed in future phases).
- **reports/**: Output reports and visualizations (to be generated in later phases).

## Current Phase: Data Understanding
- Loaded the dataset and explored basic properties like shape, columns, and data types.
- Initiated the creation of a data dictionary and began checking data integrity.

## Getting Started
This project uses `uv` for managing dependencies and environments. Make sure to have `uv` installed to ensure reproducibility and compliance with constraints.

## Recent Enhancements
- Detailed statistical descriptions for all features have been added.
- Visualizations for data distributions are now included, providing insights into feature distributions.
- Missing data inspection has been implemented with both counts and heatmap visualization for better data quality assessment.
- A correlation heatmap is available to understand relationships between features, aiding in feature selection.

Feel free to explore `02_data_understanding.ipynb` for more comprehensive data analysis.
