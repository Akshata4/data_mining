|----------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Versioned, Reproducible Inference      | High     | Ensure model and transformers are versioned for consistency           | Hash model artifacts at deployment   |
| Strict Pydantic Schemas Input Validation | Medium   | Avoid runtime errors by ensuring data integrity                      | Define and enforce strict schemas    |
| Contract Testing and Idempotency       | High     | Ensures reliable and predictable API behavior                        | Conduct contract testing, ensure idempotent operations |
| API Security and Secrets Handling      | High     | Protects unauthorized access and data breaches                       | Implement secure auth mechanisms     |
| Dockerfile Best Practices              | High     | Reduces image size, enhances security, and environment consistency   | Use slim base, non-root users        |
| CI/CD and Environment Parity           | Medium   | Prevents discrepancies and eases debugging                           | Mimic production environments        |
| Performance Testing                    | High     | Ensures effectiveness, meets service level agreements                | Set and validate latency/throughput  |
| Observability and Error Handling       | High     | Facilitates diagnosis, maintains availability                        | Implement structured logging/tracing |
| Monitoring and Rollback Strategies     | High     | Maintains stability and quality control                              | Design alerts and advanced rollout strategies |

## Evidence Gaps
- Lack of hashing for reproducibility
- Missing contract and smoke/load testing scripts
- Absence of secure auth mechanisms and secret handling docs

## Concrete Fixes
- Use `hashlib` to verify model hashes (attach specific code examples)
- Enhance Pydantic models with extra validation
- Employ Docker best practices with an updated Dockerfile
