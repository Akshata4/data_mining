## Issues Table
| Issue                                   | Severity | Why                                                                  | Fix                                                                                                      |
|-----------------------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lack of Versioned Inference             | High     | Ensures consistent model behavior across environments                 | Implement model and transformer versioning with a detailed changelog                                      |
| Incomplete Input Validation             | Medium   | Minimizes runtime errors and ensures data integrity                   | Expand Pydantic schemas to cover edge cases and invalid data scenarios                                    |
| Missing Contract Tests and Idempotency  | High     | Validates API reliability and predictability                          | Develop comprehensive contract tests and ensure operations are idempotent                                 |
| Weak API Security                       | High     | Protects against unauthorized access and data breaches                | Implement OAuth2 or API key authentication, and secure secret management                                  |
| Dockerfile Lacks Best Practices         | High     | Ensures optimal performance, security, and consistency                | Use a minimal base image, run as non-root, pin dependencies, and add health checks                        |
| Insufficient CI/CD Environment Parity   | Medium   | Prevents deployment issues and eases debugging                        | Standardize environments, using infrastructure-as-code for reproducibility                                |
| Performance Metrics Undefined           | High     | Guarantees service level agreements and system capacity               | Set clear latency and throughput targets; conduct smoke and load testing                                  |
| Limited Observability                   | High     | Aids in diagnosing issues and maintaining operational health          | Implement structured logging, metrics collection, and distributed tracing                                 |
| Inadequate Error Handling               | Medium   | Reduces downtime and maintains a seamless user experience             | Introduce systematic retries, timeouts, and comprehensive error handling mechanisms                       |
| Lack of Monitoring and Alerting         | High     | Detects drift and performance bottlenecks proactively                 | Establish drift and SLO monitoring; implement real-time alerting mechanisms                               |
| No Rollback or Deployment Strategy      | High     | Supports controlled updates and interventions                         | Design rollback strategies; adopt blue-green and canary deployment approaches                             |

## Evidence Gaps
- **Tests**: Absence of contract and idempotency tests; inadequate load and smoke testing scripts.
- **Files/Artifacts**: Missing secure auth mechanisms documentation; lack of configuration for structured logging and metrics collection.
- **Plots/Reports**: No performance benchmarks or drift detection graphs.

## Concrete Fixes with Code Hints
- **Model Versioning**: Integrate version tags in model artifacts and update metadata files with changes.
- **Pydantic Validation**: `@validator` decorators for input constraints and error checks.
- **Contract Testing**: Use tools such as Pact to generate and verify API contracts.
- **Security Enhancements**: Implement Flask-Security or FastAPI HTTPBearer/OAuth2 schemes.
- **CI/CD Improvements**: Use Terraform or Ansible for environment setup; Jenkins/GitHub Actions for pipeline integration.
- **Observability Enhancements**: Integrate Prometheus for metrics, use ELK stack for logging, OpenTelemetry for tracing.
- **Error Handling**: Add retry logic using `tenacity` or similar library, and configure timeout settings appropriately.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Implement Grafana for real-time metrics and alerting dashboards.

## Final Verdict: **REVISE**

## Acceptance Checklist
- [ ] Establish versioned models and transformers.
- [ ] Ensure comprehensive Pydantic schema coverage.
- [ ] Develop and pass contract tests.
- [ ] Implement secure authentication and secrets handling.
- [ ] Follow Docker best practices with non-root, slim base images.
- [ ] Validate CI/CD environments match production.
- [ ] Set and validate latency/throughput targets.
- [ ] Deploy observability tools (logs, metrics, tracing).
